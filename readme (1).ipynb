We will use the Python Libraries for Data Science and Data Visualization to explore data set variants and understand data structures, anomalies, patterns and relationships. The analysis in this part should be structured,\n",

To that end, we'll create a slide deck that uses polished illustrations to communicate our results. This part of the project should use extensively the first part of the project. Define one or two main paths in our exploration, choose relevant visualizations along that path, then refine them to create a story for our readers to understand what we found."
